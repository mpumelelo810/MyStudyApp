git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
(Replace your-username/your-repo-name.git with your actual repository URL)

Create and activate a virtual environment:
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Python dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file:
In the root directory of your project, create a file named .env and add the following lines. Replace placeholder values with your own secure secrets.

Code snippet

SECRET_KEY='your_super_secret_key_here_generate_a_strong_one'
DATABASE_URL='sqlite:///app.db'
OFFLINE_MODE='false' # Set to 'true' to simulate offline behavior (primarily for testing purposes)
SECRET_KEY: A strong, random string used for session management and cryptographic operations. Crucial for security in production.

DATABASE_URL: The connection string for your database. The default sqlite:///app.db uses a SQLite database file named app.db in the project root. For production, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Database Setup
After installation, set up your database using Flask-Migrate:

Initialize Flask-Migrate repository (first time only):

Bash

flask db init
Create initial database migration script:

Bash

flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
Apply migrations to create database tables:

Bash

flask db upgrade
This will create the app.db file and all necessary tables.

Running the Application
To run the Flask development server:

Bash

flask run
The application should now be accessible in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
5. API Endpoints
The backend provides a set of RESTful API endpoints, mostly requiring user authentication (@login_required).

Authentication (/auth):

GET /auth/login: Login page.

POST /auth/login: Authenticate user.

GET /auth/logout: Logout user.

GET /auth/register: Registration page.

POST /auth/register: Register new user.

Courses (/courses):

GET /courses/: List user's enrolled courses.

GET /courses/<course_code>: View a specific course and its sections.

GET /courses/api/<course_code>/sections: API Get sections for a course (JSON).

GET /courses/admin/add: Add new course (Admin only).

POST /courses/admin/add: Submit new course (Admin only).

Content (/content):

GET /content/notes/add: Add new note form.

POST /content/notes/add: Submit new note.

GET /content/notes/<int:note_id>: View specific note.

GET /content/api/sections/<int:section_id>/notes: API Get notes for a section (JSON).

GET /content/questions/add: Add new question form.

POST /content/questions/add: Submit new question.

(Refer to app/auth/routes.py, app/courses/routes.py, app/content/routes.py for detailed route logic and form fields.)

6. Offline Functionality
The application is designed to work effectively offline using a service-worker.js.

Caching Strategy: Implements a "cache-first, then network" strategy for static assets (CSS, JS, images, CDN resources) and a "network-first, then cache" strategy for dynamic API responses.

Offline Fallback: An OFFLINE_URL (/offline) is provided as a fallback page when network navigation requests fail.

Service Worker Registration: Ensure your frontend JavaScript (e.g., app/static/js/responsive.js or a dedicated pwa.js file) registers the service worker:

JavaScript

// Example service worker registration in your frontend JS
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
      .then(registration => console.log('ServiceWorker registered:', registration))
      .catch(registrationError => console.log('ServiceWorker registration failed:', registrationError));
  });
}
Make sure to serve service-worker.js from the root of your domain for it to control all paths.

7. Deployment
For production deployments, flask run is not recommended.

Gunicorn
You can deploy the application using Gunicorn, a Python WSGI HTTP Server.

Bash

gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 run:app
-w 4: Specifies 4 worker processes (adjust based on your server's CPU cores).

-b 0.0.0.0:5000: Binds the server to all network interfaces on port 5000.

run:app: Tells Gunicorn to load the app object from the run.py module.

Other Platforms
The application can be deployed to various cloud platforms such as:

Heroku

AWS Elastic Beanstalk / EC2

DigitalOcean / Linode / Vultr (VPS with Nginx/Apache proxy)

Consult the documentation for your chosen platform for specific deployment instructions.
